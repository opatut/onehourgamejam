# One Hour Game Jam 178: Consume

I am kind of dissapointed here, but mostly of myself.

I wasn't really able to come up with anything that's realistically possible within such short time. Kind of lacked inspiration. I love to interpret themes from lots of different angles, which is why I prefer ambigous themes that can basically mean anything.

I settled on "fuel consumption" at some point and figured I'd make a game where one drives a vehicle and has to do so in the most fuel conserving way possible.

The gameplay should have been one directional (only forward along the screen, like a platformer) and you could only accelerate (e.g. clicking any button). You'd drive through hilly terrain, where of course uphill stretches would slow you down and cost more fuel to accelerate on, but going too fast on flat terrain would also cost more fuel due to air resistance.

I simply pulled in a [car from opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/content/car-0) and didn't bother with it much, but then started to generate the terrain. However, that was harder than expected, not due to the maths, but due to my lack of familiarity with the Godot engine, especially its 3D part and the API thereof.

I didn't even finish generating the 3D shape properly, let alone making it a physics body that the car could drive across. And even then I would have been missing the most important part, the drive mechanics.

Lesson learned: one hour is not enough to learn a new API this complex. Too bad I didn't get to playing around with the air-resistance and acceleration fuel consumption mechanics. 

See you in a week :)
